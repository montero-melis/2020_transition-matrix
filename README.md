Solve a "magic trick" that circulated during the Coronavirus crisis, under the
heading "Stay at home" ("Qu√©date en casa"). It had people move freely on a 4x4
board where each cell was a card that denoted one of the rooms at home. In the
end the magician has everyone converge onto the same room, independently of how
they moved on previous trials.

I can't find a link to a video of the trick. It circulated on whatsapp in March
2020.

I wanted to extend the problem to a 10x10 matrix with several members of a
family moving simultaneously to make it even more surprising. With the approach
presented here, this isn't a problem.
